# Uber Trip Analysis

## Introduction
This project is about extracting insights from UBER pickups/trips in New York City from Jan 2015 to June 2015. Also, other For-Hire Vehicles (FHV)trip data is being extracted, manipulated and compared to analyze the performance of UBER. 

### Description
•	Extracted business insights from UBER trips/number of vehicles in New York City from Jan 2015 to June 2015 with other For-Hire Vehicles (FHV)trip data (CSV files) . 

•	Manipulated and compared the total trips & number of vehicles used for every hour, day& month by UBER & other FHV using PROC SQL, PROC MEAN, FREQ, MACROS, GPLOTS for same base offices to compare their performances.

•	Found a business insight on UBER’s performance that it gives maximum number of rides using minimum number of vehicles for the same base offices compared to other FHV, which helps them to argue with the Mayor so as to uncap UBER services compared to others in NY city.
